            Hello, Darling...<br>
            I don’t even know how to begin. I’ve been silent for too long.
            <br><br>
            Time flew by so fast, yet there were days when it dragged on painfully slow. Days when I’d look at the sky and wonder where you were, what you were feeling, if you ever thought of me. There were moments when I wanted to just reach out, say something... anything... but I pushed that urge down.
            <br><br>
            For the past five months, you haven’t left my heart for a single day. I wake up thinking about you and fall asleep remembering you again. It feels like you’ve become a part of me like a warm light deep within my soul.
            <br><br>
            This web site is a temple of memory, where what will never fade still lives.<br>Here, our moments are kept safe - my words, the music that played for us, like the echo of a heart resounding in the silence.  
            <br><br>
            I don’t know if you will ever read this. But if you do, know that I remember <em>everything</em>. Every glance, every word, every moment woven from light and warmth.<br>
            And perhaps, I always will.<br>
            I’d love to.
            <br><br>
            Because some things are beyond time.<br>
            Like a warm evening, soaked in the vibe of spring. Like the stars that, that night, shone only for us...
