            <p>
                <em>Darling</em>, this page is a quiet little garden of our memories, a place where I gather the moments we once shared and lay them down gently, like pressed flowers in a book.<br>
                Here, you'll find fragments of our days together, the glances, the silences that said more than words ever could. Every post is a whisper from my heart to yours, a soft echo of the past that still lives within me. This is a love letter stretched out across time, written piece by piece. For you. Always for you.

                <p>
                    We first spoke on Instagram.
                    <br><br>
                    After a few weeks of hints, we finally spoke. Yes, my dear, you did the first move. You posted on your private Instagram account, which was called <strong>wsdbwl</strong> back then, with the profile picture of a Badger from Breaking Bad, a story with a poll asking if anyone wanted to chat. I replied to that poll. After a while, you reached out to me... I think it was "holaa"...
                    <br>
                    What did you feel when you sent that message? What was your emotion just before you pressed send?
                    <br><br>
                    That same day, my dad returned from a business trip from Russia. I clearly remember us all sitting at the table during lunch, talking, and then I got your message. What was my emotion when I received it? I can’t describe it in words! It was pure beatitude.
                    <br>
                    I guess it was a Saturday. I remember you telling me that you hoped I would finally talk to you at school.

            <section class="memory">
                <span class="date">March 27, 2023</span>
                <p>
                    It was a Monday.
                    <br><br>
                    I walked to school with a storm inside me, not fear, no, something far sweeter. A trembling anticipation… or maybe both. I felt truly, utterly happy, the kind of happiness that had become my constant companion ever since we began speaking.
                    <br><br>
                    The third lesson was coming to an end, and I sat there, restless, my heart pounding like a mad drum. Then, Taimas and I stepped out into the patio and settled on a bench, right here: (38.35895419352399, -0.43088445615408594).<br>
                    I couldn’t bring myself to walk up to you.<br>
                    So we just sat there, and inside me, everything was twisting, spinning, blooming.
                    <br><br>
                    And then... I see you walking.<br>
                    You were with your friends, I think it was Sara and Lilith. You stood slightly to the left of them, closer to me. And then, it happened. The moment our eyes met for the first time since our very first conversation.
                    <br><br>
                    I don’t think I will <em>ever</em> forget that glance!
                    <br><br>
                    Shy, filled with love, so achingly sincere. Your arms hung at your sides, then crossed lightly at your left hip, your hands clasped together as if you felt a little unsure of yourself.
                    <br><br>
                    Ohhh My Goooodddnessssss!!!!!!!
                    <br><br>
                    It lasted only a heartbeat, but within that fleeting instant, there was an <em>entire universe of feeling</em>.<br>
                    I can barely decide which moment was happier - our first kiss or this one.
                    <br><br>
                    During the second break, Taimas and I were walking around the school, and like an absolute fool, I shook your hand and cracked your thumb. Why would I do that? God, that was so awkwardddd.<br>
                    Later, you wrote in your Instagram notes: "me duele la mano".<br>
                    I’m such an idiot. I have no idea what I was thinking.
                    <br><br>
                    And then, when classes were over, we ran into each other on the stairs, the ones to the left if you’re facing the school building entrance. We were both walking down, and the first thing I did was apologize. You just smiled and told me it was okay. After that, we walked home together.<br>
                    We parted ways at this intersection: (38.36079198226404, -0.4277665933100442).

                <p>
                    That day, I was going to tell you something important. I think I finished around 14:10 or maybe 15:00, and my last class was Valenciano. We went down to the sports field with the bleachers because there were so few people in the classroom. <strong>And they let us out earlier!</strong> I had even texted you before, saying I needed to tell you something important.<br>
                    I could've waited... I don’t know why I didn’t.

                    And the next day, I walked out of school with you, and we were talking about the kind of pensamientos we had about each other.<br>

                    <br><br>
                    That line is from the Beatles song All My Loving. On April 4th, we walked home together after school, like we always did, talking about something or other, and parted ways at our usual intersection. I told you I’d be in France for a few days. That evening, I wrote in my Instagram notes: "Close your eyes and I'll kiss you, tomorrow I'll miss you."
                    <br><br>
                    You replied with "do it", but then deleted it and wrote instead: "I'll send all my loving to you."
                    <br><br>
                    Later, when we were chatting on Telegram and talking about music, you mentioned that you were paying for Spotify Premium, and I told you that you could listen to any music for free using a Telegram bot. I told you to name any song so I could send you the link, and explained that the link below the song file was just an ad, the one above was the real one. You picked All My Loving by the Beatles, and I sent it to you.
                    <br><br>
                    Then you said something like: "<em>mi estado actual es bailando en mi habitación.</em>"

                    I recall how we randomly ran into each other when I was heading home after English academy. Not the first time, when you were walking with your friend Sara and we crossed paths at the crosswalk (38.3637914, -0.4265128), but the second time, when you were alone.
                    <br><br>
                    It happened a bit farther from the academy. I was already on my way toward the park on Goleta Street because I usually took that route. I noticed you from a distance, walking while doing something on your phone. When we stopped together at the traffic light (38.3627325, -0.4242205), I pretended not to see you for a few moments because I felt a little awkward. But, God, inside, I was ecstatic!
                    <br>
                    I said hi, and we started walking together, talking. You told me you were just out for a walk, and I was on my way home. Our encounter was brief, but it was perfect.
                    <br><br>
                    My happiest coincidence ever!... Or maybe it wasn't a coincidence... who knows :)

                    I remember one of your stories on your Instagram account <strong>wsdbwl</strong>. You were out walking, and your phone had only one percent battery left, and you posted a photo that looked a lot like this one. (I took this one on April 9, 2025 at 19:40.)
                </p>
                <img src="assets\img\IMG_7600.jpg" alt="IMG_7600.jpg">
                <p>
                    I remember wanting to reply to that story, but I just couldn’t find the right words. You see, in Russian there's a word "жиза", it basically means that a situation is super relatable, like something that happens to you often in real life. It’s a slang word, so there’s really no proper translation for it. And if you try to translate it literally, it turns into complete nonsense. And that was the only thing that came to my mind back then... but I didn’t know how to explain it to you, so I ended up not replying at all.

                    Do you remember that time we were walking near the lighthouse, and when we passed by (38.3561231, -0.4088200), we crossed paths with a guy pushing his grandmother in a wheelchair? And when the granny saw us, she said, "Que pareja más bonita." It gave me such a warm and pleasant feeling that I can’t quite describe. I asked you a moment later, "Nos ha llamado pareja?" and you answered a bit shyly, "Si."
                    <br><br>
                    Oh... My love, I remember that as if it was yesterday!

                    We were talking on Telegram through video messages… talking longer than ever before. You told me so many things that night.
                    <br><br>
                    I remember saying how much I wanted to embrace you, and you answered, "A lo mejor cuando vuelvas hago algo más que abrazarte." I never really understood what you meant. And when I came back, we didn’t say a word to each other.
                    <br>
                    Or when you said, "No me has hecho sufrir ninguna vez." Every time I remember that, my heart just shatters...
                    <br>
                    And when I added you to my Telegram channel with my poems, you read them and said, "Si te digo que estoy llorando, me crees?"
                    <br><br>
                    Oh, darling...
                    <br><br>
                    By the time it was already getting light outside, around 3:30 AM, you told me you needed to sleep because you had to wake up for school. You couldn’t skip that day because they were giving out biology grades. You went to bed, and I went outside to do pull-ups on the bar.
                    <br>
                    I remember that feeling so vividly. The cool night air, the empty streets, me trying to record you a video message but having nowhere to put my phone. Some guy pulled up in a red car and walked into his house. I barely even noticed him.
                    <br><br>
                    I was gleeful. So damn gleeful. I had never felt anything like that before.

                    The day I first told you I loved you.
                    <br><br>
                    I was drunk that night. I remember drinking Beefeater London Dry Gin, mixing it with apple juice. Wrote to you around midnight: "Te quiero ❤️❤️❤️" and you answered "Te quiero más" ... "Pasa algo?" And I said "No, solo te quería decir que te amo..."
                    <br>
                    Then I started rambling about how if I don’t text you, it doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten about you, that I just have things to do. Oh, God… what things? What the hell could have been more important than you?

                    I stayed up all night watching movies because I just couldn’t sleep. Watched "El Camino", the one about Jesse from "Breaking Bad", and "What Women Want".
                    <br>
                    These pictures were taken exactly at 5:00 AM. The sun was already rising, and I still hadn’t gone to bed.

                    It was a Thursday.<br>
                    Our last class of the day was PE, both yours and mine. Outside, it was pouring rain. I walked out of the gym and headed toward the exit. That’s when I saw you. You were standing there with some guy in an embrace, as far as I know his name is Asier. He was in my radio class last year.<br>
                    You were hugging him.<br>
                    It wasn’t the first time I’d seen something like that. Sometimes, it made me angry. Other times, I felt happy for you, you looked like you were glowing, genuinely happy.<br>
                    But in that moment, I felt… nothing.
                    <br><br>
                    I decided to wait for the rain to stop.<br>
                    But I didn’t wait under the roof outside, I went back in and sat on one of the chairs near the entrance. The same two chairs where my little brother and I usually sit during breaks.<br>
                    By the way, my brother Egor didn’t wait for the rain, he left right away without an umbrella and got completely soaked.<br>
                    I sat there thinking… about you.<br>
                    Of course. Who else would I think about at a moment like that? I was wondering if you were cold, if you’d get wet walking in the rain, if you had an umbrella… I think if that guy hadn’t been with you, I might’ve come up to you. Maybe. Maybe not. I don’t know.
                    <br><br>
                    The whole time, I was listening on repeat to the same song:
                    KRBK - "Девушка в чёрном."
                    <br><br>
                    I remember when you came inside and, after a while, walked back out. I turned my gaze away. I don’t know why I do that. I’m not shy. No. Maybe I want to look cool… unaffected. But why? I really don’t know.<br>
                    When you were coming out of the corridor that leads to the canteen, you said: "Joder, está helado."
                    I didn’t quite understand what exactly was "helado."
                </p>

                    I accidentally took this photo at 15:14 while pulling my phone out of my pocket.
                    <br><br>
                    Then my grandma called. We talked for a couple of minutes.<br>
                    Once the rain finally stopped and the sun came out, I got up and made my way home. I stepped outside, and to my disappointment you were already gone. You had left.<br>
                    I walked home completely dry, not a single raindrop touched me.<br>
                    And later that day, my dad came home from his business trip to Ethiopia, unannounced. It was a lovely surprise.

                    I walked past our spot. A black Jeep Wrangler was parked there - the car you once said you liked.

                    I don’t understand why you keep looking my TikTok profile, checking my reposts. Why, tell me. Do you really still care? Or is it just to plant false hope in me?
                    <br><br>
                    You’ve viewed my profile exactly 16 times. Not once, not twice - <strong>sixteen</strong>!!<br>
                    Why?<br>
                    There were even days when you visited my profile at the exact same time, day after day. Just recently, on March 21st, 22nd, and 23rd. And today, two hours ago.<br>
                    And in December 2024, it was a whole week straight. Every single day. December 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, and 30th. And on the 31st - New Year’s Eve - just a few hours before midnight.
                    <br><br>
                    Why??

                    And here you are again, visiting my profile. The 17th time. Three hours ago. Somewhere around 20:00. The same time as yesterday.

                    Everything's okay now :) I guess there was some kind of glitch with your TikTok. Or maybe mine. Couldn’t find it through search, and it disappeared from the profile visit history.<br>
                    But today… you checked my profile again. Around 20:00, just like before. The 18th time.
                    <br><br>
                    And at school… I haven’t seen you since Friday.  
                    You must be on that exchange program with Finland…
