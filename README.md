## About

This project is more than just code - it's a quiet expression of memory, longing, and love.  
It was shaped not only by logic and design, but by the presence of someone who once made the world feel softer.  
Every line carries a trace of that feeling - of a time when even silence between two hearts meant something.

This isn't just a project. It's a place where moments are preserved in structure and syntax -  
where the heart quietly echoes beneath the surface of what you see.

## Special Thanks

To my dearest Isabel -  
your _presence in my heart_ has been the quiet force behind this creation.  
You have inspired every part of it, not through words, but through the way you make my world feel brighter.  
This work exists because of you, and for you.  
_Thank you for being my muse._
