    <h1>101 Reasons Why I Love You</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Because you were my muse from the very beginning even in silence.</li>
        <li>Because you could feel me without needing words.</li>
        <li>For the invisible thread that held us together, even from afar.</li>
        <li>For those “just a glance” moments that said more than anything.</li>
        <li>For the way you spoke to me through music and lyrics.</li>
        <li>For that moment when you answered "Do it" and the world paused.</li>
        <li>Because that lyric game we played made me believe in magic.</li>
        <li>Because with you, I became a poet again.</li>
        <li>Because your notes on Instagram were warmer than sunlight.</li>
        <li>For that one spring when I knew I was truly loved.</li>
        <li>For your smile that reached through the screen and touched my soul.</li>
        <li>For your quiet patience when I disappeared into my head.</li>
        <li>Because even when we weren’t talking, you were still with me.</li>
        <li>Because I knew you missed me — just like I missed you.</li>
        <li>Because you made me feel wanted, without ever saying it out loud.</li>
        <li>For every time you pretended not to care, but did — deeply.</li>
        <li>For your fearless softness.</li>
        <li>For your eyes, the ones I still see when I close mine.</li>
        <li>Because you weren’t just a girl — you were a turning point in my life.</li>
        <li>Because I couldn’t forget you, no matter how hard I tried.</li>
        <li>Because after you, no one else felt real.</li>
        <li>Because you became the standard of beauty and soul.</li>
        <li>Because even your silence sounded like “I’m with you.”</li>
        <li>For that invisible electricity in our every near-touch.</li>
        <li>Because you saw something in me no one else did.</li>
        <li>Because you made me dream again.</li>
        <li>Because without you, even dreams faded.</li>
        <li>For the night you were in my headphones — and my heart.</li>
        <li>For the way you said my name — soft, but unforgettable.</li>
        <li>Because I’d give anything to hear you say it again.</li>
        <li>Because I remember your scent.</li>
        <li>Because your laughter was the purest sound I’ve ever known.</li>
        <li>For the phrases you said that still echo like prayers in my mind.</li>
        <li>Because you were the first person I ever truly prayed for.</li>
        <li>Because with you, even silence was a conversation.</li>
        <li>Because you taught me how to wait.</li>
        <li>Because you showed me love isn’t just joy — it’s depth.</li>
        <li>For the way you touched me — not with hands, but words.</li>
        <li>Because every thought of you made me want to be a better man.</li>
        <li>Because you are the brightest mark in my life.</li>
        <li>For your simplicity — the kind that was deeper than complexity.</li>
        <li>For your depth — the kind I never reached the bottom of.</li>
        <li>For how you could quiet my soul and awaken it at the same time.</li>
        <li>Because even your jealousy was sweet.</li>
        <li>For the way you looked at me — as if I was someone worth loving.</li>
        <li>Because you made me believe I could be loved.</li>
        <li>Because you were my springtime.</li>
        <li>Because you are a memory I protect like something sacred.</li>
        <li>Because you live in every poem I write — even when I don’t say your name.</li>
        <li>Because you were the reason I started writing again.</li>
        <li>Because without you, even music sounds different.</li>
        <li>Because you made me feel alive.</li>
        <li>For that almost-kiss — more powerful than any kiss I’ve ever had.</li>
        <li>Because you weren’t like anyone else — you were better.</li>
        <li>Because even your shadow was light to me.</li>
        <li>Because you felt like home.</li>
        <li>For the way one message from you could save my entire day.</li>
        <li>For your sweet little storms.</li>
        <li>For the way you got jealous — beautifully.</li>
        <li>Because I wanted to protect you from everything.</li>
        <li>Because with you, I felt strong.</li>
        <li>Because you knew exactly where my heart was.</li>
        <li>Because you took it with you.</li>
        <li>For the mornings when we thought of each other — without telling anyone.</li>
        <li>Because you were in the most important dreams.</li>
        <li>Because even when I wasn’t texting, I was thinking about you.</li>
        <li>Because I never truly fell out of love with you.</li>
        <li>Because I wanted to be with you in another lifetime too.</li>
        <li>Because every sunrise without you felt empty.</li>
        <li>Because you weren’t just a chapter — you were the meaning of the book.</li>
        <li>For your eyelashes.</li>
        <li>For your lips.</li>
        <li>For the way you said “okay.”</li>
        <li>For the way you flirted even when you were mad.</li>
        <li>Because I knew — you were mine, even if the world didn’t know.</li>
        <li>Because you never betrayed me.</li>
        <li>Because you were always honest.</li>
        <li>Because you were gentle.</li>
        <li>Because you were real.</li>
        <li>Because you were mine.</li>
        <li>Because I still love you.</li>
        <li>Because love didn’t die — it just learned how to stay quiet.</li>
        <li>Because I’d go through it all again, just to be close to you once more.</li>
        <li>Because I still hear you in my favorite songs.</li>
        <li>Because no city feels right without you in it.</li>
        <li>Because I keep looking for your rhythm in other people — but they don’t have it.</li>
        <li>Because you were art.</li>
        <li>Because you were God’s gift to my soul.</li>
        <li>Because you were light in my darkness.</li>
        <li>Because you were the most beautiful part of my life.</li>
        <li>Because you’re heartbreakingly beautiful.</li>
        <li>Because your soul was even more beautiful.</li>
        <li>Because you were the tenderness I was always missing.</li>
        <li>Because with you, I believed happiness was possible.</li>
        <li>Because you gave me more than anyone ever did.</li>
        <li>Because you were my missing half.</li>
        <li>Because you were my spring, my autumn, and everything in between.</li>
        <li>Because I still pray for you — even though I don’t know where you are.</li>
        <li>Because I want you to be happy — even if it’s not with me.</li>
        <li>Because no matter how much time passes, a part of me will always belong to you.</li>
        <li>Because I will always love you. Truly. Quietly. Eternally.</li>
