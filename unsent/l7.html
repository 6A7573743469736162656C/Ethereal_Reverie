                    What can I say in conclusion…<br>
                    Paris truly is the city of love. Everything here feels soaked in romance. There are couples everywhere, and even with the crowd and the bustle, there’s this unshakable atmosphere of serenity and intimacy.<br>
                    But I’ll say this again: Paris is a city meant for two. Not for one, not for five. Two. Of course, it depends on the reason you’re here, if it’s just a tourist trip to see the sights, eat croissants and check landmarks off a list, sure, come with ten people. But I was in a different state of mind. That’s why walking through the city with my family of five didn’t really feel right. So I chose to walk alone. On the first day and then again later.
                    <br><br>
                    And I want to add… I kept feeling this strange déjà vu. Everything around me felt oddly familiar, like I’d been there before. Maybe that’s why France doesn’t feel foreign to me. Even though I don’t speak the language, I feel at ease here.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, I never saw the Eiffel Tower at night. Not once. Maybe because I didn’t want to… maybe I was disappointed, maybe I was just sad, I don’t know, it was a mix of emotions. But one thing I’m sure of - it wasn’t random. I will return one day and see it glow, shining in the dark on some peaceful spring night.
                    <br><br>
                    And if I ever come back to Paris, it’ll only be alone. Or with you. With YOU. You, my darling. No one else matters to me in that city. Or in this life.
