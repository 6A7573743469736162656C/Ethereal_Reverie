        <h1>101 Reasons Why I Love You</h1>
        <p>
            1. Because you were my muse from the very beginning even in silence.<br><br>
            2. Because you could feel me without needing words.<br><br>
            3. For the invisible thread that held us together, even from afar.<br><br>
            4. For those “just a glance” moments that said more than anything.<br><br>
            5. For the way you spoke to me through music and lyrics.<br><br>
            6. For that moment when you answered "Do it" and the world paused.<br><br>
            7. Because that lyric game we played made me believe in magic.<br><br>
            8. Because <em>you made me a poet</em>.<br><br>
            9. Because your notes on Instagram were warmer than sunlight.<br><br>
            10. For that one spring when I knew I was truly loved.<br><br>
            11. For your smile that reached through the screen and touched my soul.<br><br>
            12. Because your mind was a galaxy I never finished exploring.<br><br>
            13. Because even when we weren’t talking, you were still with me.<br><br>
            14. Because something in me always knew you were thinking of me too.<br><br>
            15. Because you made me feel wanted, without ever saying it out loud.<br><br>
            16. For every time you pretended not to care, but did deeply.<br><br>
            17. For your fearless softness.<br><br>
            18. <em>For your eyes</em>, the ones I still see when I close mine.<br><br>
            19. Because you weren’t just a girl, you were a turning point in my life.<br><br>
            20. Because I couldn’t forget you, no matter how hard I tried.<br><br>
            21. Because after you, no one else felt real.<br><br>
            22. Because you became the standard of beauty and soul.<br><br>
            23. Because your silence made me realize how much I loved your words.<br><br>
            24. For that invisible electricity in our every near-touch.<br><br>
            25. Because you saw something in me no one else did.<br><br>
            26. Because you made me dream again.<br><br>
            27. Because without you, even dreams faded.<br><br>
            28. For the night you were in my headphones and my heart.<br><br>
            29. For the way you made even the simplest moments feel like they mattered.<br><br>
            30. Because I’d give anything to hear you say my name again.<br><br>
            31. Because I still remember the scent of your perfume.<br><br>
            32. Because your laughter is the loveliest sound I’ve ever known.<br><br>
            33. For the phrases you said that still echo in my mind.<br><br>
            34. Because you are the first person I ever <em>truly prayed</em> for.<br><br>
            35. Because with you, even silence was a conversation.<br><br>
            36. Because you taught me how to wait.<br><br>
            37. Because you showed me love isn’t just joy, it’s depth.<br><br>
            38. For the way you touched me, not with hands, but words.<br><br>
            39. Because every thought of you made me want to be a <em>better man</em>.<br><br>
            40. Because you are the brightest mark in my life.<br><br>
            41. For the way your depth was hidden behind an effortless smile.<br><br>
            42. For your depth, the kind I never reached the bottom of.<br><br>
            43. For how you could quiet my soul and awaken it at the same time.<br><br>
            44. Because in every fleeting moment, you made me feel understood.<br><br>
            45. For the way <em>you looked at me</em>, as if I was someone worth loving.<br><br>
            46. Because you made me believe I could be loved.<br><br>
            47. Because you are my springtime.<br><br>
            48. Because you are a memory I protect like something sacred.<br><br>
            49. Because you live in <em>every poem</em> I write, even when I don’t say your name.<br><br>
            50. Because you are the reason I started writing again.<br><br>
            51. Because without you, even music sounds different.<br><br>
            52. Because you made me feel <em>alive</em>.<br><br>
            53. For that almost-kiss more powerful than any kiss we’ve ever had.<br><br>
            54. Because you aren’t like anyone else.<br><br>
            55. Because even your shadow was light to me.<br><br>
            56. Because you were the spark that ignited something I didn’t know I needed.<br><br>
            57. For the way one message from you could save my entire day.<br><br>
            58. For the way your presence could change the atmosphere, without saying a word.<br><br>
            59. For the way you loved fiercely, without reservation.<br><br>
            60. Because I want to protect you from everything.<br><br>
            61. Because you were both strong and intelligent, and you wore it with grace.<br><br>
            62. Because you knew exactly where my heart was.<br><br>
            63. Because you took my heart with you.<br><br>
            64. For the mornings when we thought of each other without telling each other.<br><br>
            65. Because you were in the most important dreams.<br><br>
            66. Because even when I wasn’t texting, I was thinking about you.<br><br>
            67. Because I <em>never</em> truly fell out of love with you.<br><br>
            68. Because I want to be with you in another lifetime too.<br><br>
            69. Because every single sunrise without you felt empty.<br><br>
            70. Because you aren’t just a chapter, you are <em>the meaning</em> of the book.<br><br>
            71. For your eyelashes.<br><br>
            72. For your lips.<br><br>
            73. For the way you said "okay".<br><br>
            74. For the way you flirted.<br><br>
            75. Because I knew you were mine, even if the world didn’t know.<br><br>
            76. <em>Because you never betrayed me</em>.<br><br>
            77. Because you were always honest.<br><br>
            78. Because you are gentle.<br><br>
            79. Because you are real.<br><br>
            80. Because you were the reason I started believing in fate.<br><br>
            81. Because I love you more every day.<br><br>
            82. Because love didn’t die, it just learned how to stay quiet.<br><br>
            83. Because I’d go through it all again, just to be close to you once more.<br><br>
            84. Because I still hear you in my favorite songs.<br><br>
            85. Because no city feels right without you in it.<br><br>
            86. Because I keep looking for your rhythm in other people, but they don’t have it.<br><br>
            87. Because you are ART.<br><br>
            88. Because you are <em>God’s gift</em> to my soul.<br><br>
            89. Because you are light in my darkness.<br><br>
            90. Because you are the most beautiful part of my life.<br><br>
            91. Because you’re heartbreakingly beautiful.<br><br>
            92. Because your soul is even more beautiful.<br><br>
            93. Because you were the tenderness I was always missing.<br><br>
            94. Because with you, I began to see that love can heal what’s broken.<br><br>
            95. Because you gave me more than anyone ever did.<br><br>
            96. Because you are <em>my missing half</em>.<br><br>
            97. Because you were my spring, my autumn, and everything in between.<br><br>
            98. Because <em>I still pray for you</em>, even though I don’t know where you are.<br><br>
            99. <em>Because I want you to be happy, even if it’s not with me.</em><br><br>
            100. Because no matter how much time passes, a part of me will always belong to you.<br><br>
            101. Because I will always love you. Truly. Quietly. Eternally.
