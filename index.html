            Hello, Darling...
            <br><br>
            I don’t even know how to begin. I’ve been silent for too long.
            <br><br>
            Time flew by so fast, yet there were days when it dragged on painfully slow. Days when I’d look at the sky and wonder where you were, what you were feeling, if you ever thought of me. There were moments when I wanted to just reach out, say something... anything... but I pushed that urge down.
            <br><br>
            For the past five months, you haven’t left my heart for a single day. I wake up thinking about you and fall asleep remembering you again. It feels like you’ve become a part of me like a warm light deep within my soul.
            <br><br>
            This web site is a temple of memory, where what will never fade still lives.<br>
            Here, our moments are kept safe - my words, the music that played for us, like the echo of a heart resounding in the silence.  
            <br><br>
            I don’t know if you will ever read this. I don’t know if our paths will cross again. I don’t know if you’ll ever want to hear me out. But if one day you find yourself here, if your eyes drift over these lines I want you to know - I remember <em>everything</em>. You are not just a memory. You are a living part of me. Every glance of yours, every word, every moment woven from light and warmth.<br>
            And perhaps, those moments will always resound.<br>
            I'd love for them to.<br>
            Because some things are beyond time.<br>
            Like a warm evening, soaked in the vibe of spring. Like the stars that, <em>that night</em>, shone only for us...
        </p>
        <p id="text-right"><small><small><em>02.04.2025</em></small></small></p><br><br>
        <p>
            So why am I writing in English and not in Spanish?
            <br><br>
            No offense, but English feels like a richer language to me than Spanish. Though, to be fair, it’s probably because my Spanish isn’t deep enough to fully express everything I feel. I’m afraid that if I write in Spanish, I won’t be able to capture it all. I’ve tried... and maybe I succeeded, but not quite the way I wanted to. 
            <br><br>
            Since I hardly believe you’ll ever read this, I’m writing in the language that feels most natural to me. But still, deep down, there’s a small hope… and that’s why I’m not writing in Russian.
            <br><br>
            But letters on a screen, or even on paper, will never convey emotions the way words do when spoken in person, <em>looking into someone's eyes</em>. No font trembles with nervousness, no commas capture the breath held before an important confession. Text remains cold, no matter how sincerely the words are chosen. There are no subtle shifts in tone, no tenderness in the way a name can be spoken, no pauses filled with something greater than mere silence.<br>
            In a real conversation, emotions don’t hide behind letters. They’re there in every glance, in every movement of the hands, in every subtle shift of expression. When you speak in person, it’s impossible to conceal what you feel. The voice betrays everything, even the things we’re too afraid to admit.  
            <br><br>
            That’s why these lines are just a faint attempt. I can write endlessly, but not a single word here will ever compare to one fleeting glance, to one touch. Because true emotions don’t live in words. They live between us, somewhere between you and me, in an <strong>Ethereal Reverie</strong>.

            Here, you’ll find our <a class="index-links" href="memories.html">memories</a> - the moments we shared, the words we said to each other.<br>
            My <a class="index-links" href="poetry.html">poems</a>, all of them written for you and only you. Every single one is about you. You were, are, and always will be my one and only muse.<br>
            You’ll also find <a class="index-links" href="about.html">songs</a> here… songs that are <em>ours</em>. Maybe not all of them yet, but I keep adding to the playlist, every time I hear something that reminds me of you and only you.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ve added <a class="index-links" href="101.html">101 reasons why I love you</a>, in case you ever wondered why I can’t let go. And the <a class="index-links" href="unsent.html">unsent letters</a> I once wrote for you. I will keep writing them, adding to the page, as my heart finds the words. Perhaps they are meant to stay unread… or simply waiting for the right moment.

            And for now… that’s quite it.<br>
            Someday, I’ll surely add something more. I don’t know when, or what exactly…<br>
            But I know that as long as I keep carrying you in my heart there will always be more to say.
