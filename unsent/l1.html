                    It’s raining outside. That scent - damp air, wet pavements suddenly brought me back to 2013, when I was just five years old.<br>
                    I remember… it was autumn, in a town near Moscow called Podolsk. My dad picked me up from kindergarten, we drove home in our blue Honda. On the radio, "Coming Home" by Skylar Grey & Diddy was playing. I was filled with excitement, eager to get home, grab my PSP... It had a photo of a helicopter as the wallpaper. It was loaded with games and music.
                    <br><br>
                    Back then, I had no idea I’d one day be living in Spain, speaking Spanish, walking under different skies.<br>
                    And where were you in that moment, my love? Do you ever think about that part of your childhood?
                    <br><br>
                    Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about my past... not in a sad way, but with deep nostalgia.<br>
                    These memories are some of my most intimate, sacred ones. No one in the world knows them like I do… not even my family would remember the details. But I want to share them with you. I don’t know why… I just feel this kind of urge.
