                    I’m back at our place again.
                    <br><br>
                    I wrote in my Telegram channel that I’d be waiting for you today from 10:00 to 10:30, just in case you’d want to take part in recreating the memories of our first and last kisses. 
                    <br><br>
                    And now it’s already 10:32 and you’re still not here. To be honest, I knew it would be like this. I sent that "message" into the void, and you probably never even saw it. Maybe someone does check my channel, maybe that someone is you… but most likely those views are just from me going back to look at it again and again.
                    <br><br>
                    Four people passed by - three with dogs, one without, and every time a silhouette appeared from behind the flower bushes, I hoped it would be you. But it wasn’t. 
                    <br><br>
                    Of course it’s silly, but there’s something about it I can’t quite explain. I can’t say I like it, but I can’t say I don’t either. 
                    <br><br>
                    Should I wait another ten minutes? Maybe you’ll come…
