## Security Best Practices

I recommend the following best practices to ensure the security of this project:

- **Keep software up to date**: Always use the latest stable version of dependencies.

- **Validate user input**: Ensure all input is properly validated and sanitized to avoid common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Limit access**: Follow the principle of least privilege and restrict access to sensitive data and functionality.
- **Encrypt sensitive data**: Use encryption to protect sensitive data, both at rest and in transit.

If I identify a security vulnerability that requires a patch, I will:

- Assess the severity of the vulnerability.
- Develop and test a patch.
- Release the patch as soon as possible, following best practices for responsible disclosure.
