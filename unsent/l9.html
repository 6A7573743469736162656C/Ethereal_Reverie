                    My darling,
                    <br><br>
                    Have you ever thought about the sky? The clouds that drifted above us on the evening of our first kiss, they carried those memories away as they floated off, pouring them down as rain somewhere far from here.
                    <br><br>
                    But the sun and moon that shone on us then still shine now. They remember everything. Each day they look down on that place and recall the hundreds of millions of heartfelt kisses they’ve witnessed throughout their existence. And among them ours. The first. The second. The third... and the last.
                    <br><br>
                    The moon remembers our last kiss. She remembers it clearly, just as she remembers the hundred million others she’s watched before and since. She’s seen bitter goodbyes and long-awaited reunions, between families, lovers, friends... each with their own story, and she’s been witness to them all.
                    <br><br>
                    Who came before us in our spot, and who will come after... who will remember us, and that evening when our hearts met in a kiss, if not the two of us? Only the wind, the sun, and the moon.
                    <br><br>
                    The wind kissed your lips and mine, it danced around us, waltzing with romance itself, hand in hand. That warm, springtime-almost-summer breeze from the sea... it, too, will remember us, and that evening.
                </p>
