                    We first spoke on Instagram.
                    <br><br>
                    After a few weeks of hints, we finally spoke. Yes, my dear, you did the first move. You posted on your private Instagram account, which was called <strong>wsdbwl</strong> back then, with the profile picture of a Badger from Breaking Bad, a story with a poll asking if anyone wanted to chat. I replied to that poll. After a while, you reached out to me... I think it was "holaa"...
                    <br>
                    What did you feel when you sent that message? What was your emotion just before you pressed send?
                    <br><br>
                    That same day, my dad returned from a business trip from Russia. I clearly remember us all sitting at the table during lunch, talking, and then I got your message. What was my emotion when I received it? I can’t describe it in words! It was pure beatitude.
                    <br>
                    I guess it was a Saturday. I remember you telling me that you hoped I would finally talk to you at school.

                    I recall how we randomly ran into each other when I was heading home after English academy? Not the first time, when you were walking with your friend Sara and we crossed paths at the crosswalk (38.3637914, -0.4265128), but the second time, when you were alone.
                    <br><br>
                    It happened a bit farther from the academy. I was already on my way toward the park on Goleta Street because I usually took that route. I noticed you from a distance, walking while doing something on your phone. When we stopped together at the traffic light (38.3627325, -0.4242205), I pretended not to see you for a few moments because I felt a little awkward. But, God, inside, I was ecstatic!
                    <br>
                    I said hi, and we started walking together, talking. You told me you were just out for a walk, and I was on my way home. Our encounter was brief, but it was perfect.
                    <br><br>
                    My happiest coincidence ever!... Or maybe it wasn't a coincidence... who knows :)

                    Do you remember that time we were walking near the lighthouse, and when we passed by (38.3561231, -0.4088200), we crossed paths with a guy pushing his grandmother in a wheelchair? And when the granny saw us, she said, "Que pareja más bonita." It gave me such a warm and pleasant feeling that I can’t quite describe. I asked you a moment later, "Nos ha llamado pareja?" and you answered a bit shyly, "Si."
                    <br><br>
                    Oh... My love, I remember that as if it was yesterday!

                    At 6 AM, I was already on the plane heading to Helsinki, then from there to St. Petersburg, and after that, to Moscow.

                <p>
                    We were talking on Telegram through video messages… talking longer than ever before. You told me so many things that night.
                    <br><br>
                    I remember saying how much I wanted to embrace you, and you answered, "A lo mejor cuando vuelvas hago algo más que abrazarte." I never really understood what you meant. And when I came back, we didn’t say a word to each other.
                    <br>
                    Or when you said, "No me has hecho sufrir ninguna vez." Every time I remember that, my heart just shatters...
                    <br>
                    And when I added you to my Telegram channel with my poems, you read them and said, "Si te digo que estoy llorando, me crees?"
                    <br><br>
                    Oh, darling...
                    <br><br>
                    By the time it was already getting light outside, around 3:30 AM, you told me you needed to sleep because you had to wake up for school. You couldn’t skip that day because they were giving out biology grades. You went to bed, and I went outside to do pull-ups on the bar.
                    <br>
                    I remember that feeling so vividly. The cool night air, the empty streets, me trying to record you a video message but having nowhere to put my phone. Some guy pulled up in a red car and walked into his house. I barely even noticed him.
                    <br><br>
                    I was gleeful. So damn gleeful. I had never felt anything like that before.
                </p>

                    I took this photo that evening, June 13th, at 8:21 PM Moscow time.

                    The day I first told you I loved you.
                    <br><br>
                    I was drunk that night. I remember drinking Beefeater London Dry Gin, mixing it with apple juice. Wrote to you around midnight: "Te quiero ❤️❤️❤️" and you answered "Te quiero más" ... "Pasa algo?" And I said "No, solo te quería decir que te amo..."
                    <br>
                    Then I started rambling about how if I don’t text you, it doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten about you, that I just have things to do. Oh, God… what things? What the hell could have been more important than you?
                </p>
                <img src="assets\img\test.jpg" alt="test">

                    I stayed up all night watching movies because I just couldn’t sleep. Watched El Camino, the one about Jesse from Breaking Bad, and What Women Want (2000).
                    <br>
                    These pictures were taken exactly at 5:00 AM. The sun was already rising, and I still hadn’t gone to bed.
