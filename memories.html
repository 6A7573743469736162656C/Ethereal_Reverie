                <em>Darling</em>, this page is a quiet little garden of our memories, a place where I gather the moments we once shared and lay them down gently, like pressed flowers in a book.<br>
                Here, you'll find fragments of our days together, the glances, the silences that said more than words ever could. Every post is a whisper from my heart to yours, a soft echo of the past that still lives within me. This is a love letter stretched out across time, written piece by piece. For you. Always for you.

            <span class="date">February 2023</span>
                <p>
                    It was February 2023 when the thought first crossed my mind that I liked you. You were sitting with your friend Sara on the steps on the north side of our school, and I was standing at the corner with my mates (right here: 38.3596274, -0.4306038), stealing glances in your direction. And every now and then… I’d catch you looking back. Those stolen looks, those quiet moments from afar, maybe that’s when it all truly began.

                    <br><br>
                    I remember one day, as we walked past you, Taimas told me you had been talking about me. I didn’t believe him, he joked around a lot and said all kinds of nonsense. But still… something in me sparked, a small hope lit up.<br>
                    I also remember how the kazakh and I used to walk laps around the school, and you and Sara would walk in the opposite direction. Every time we crossed paths, I’d catch your breathtaking glance. That look of yours... it stayed with me, long after you passed by. And it’s still with me.

                    We first spoke on Instagram.
                    <br><br>
                    After a few weeks of hints, we finally spoke. Yes, my dear, you did the first move. You posted on your private Instagram account, which was called <strong>wsdbwl</strong> back then, with the profile picture of a Badger from Breaking Bad, a story with a poll asking if anyone wanted to chat. I replied to that poll. After a while, you reached out to me... I think it was "holaa"...
                    <br>
                    What did you feel when you sent that message? What was your emotion just before you pressed send?
                    <br><br>
                    That same day, my dad returned from a business trip from Russia. I clearly remember us all sitting at the table during lunch, talking, and then I got your message. What was my emotion when I received it? I can’t describe it in words! It was pure beatitude.
                    <br>
                    I guess it was a Saturday. I remember you telling me that you hoped I would finally talk to you at school.

                    One of the first evenings we ever talked, we ended up speaking about the Northern Lights. I still remember how it sounds in Spanish "Aurora boreal". Such a beautiful word... I really like it. You told me it was your dream to see them one day, and I sent you this photo:
                </p>
                <img src="assets\img\8.jpg" alt="8.jpg">
                <p>
                    I told you it wasn’t me who took that photo, but my father, he captured it while flying over northern Russia.
                    <br><br>
                    Your dream came true on the 9th of February, 2025.

                <span class="date">March 27, 2023</span>
                <p>
                    It was a Monday.
                    <br><br>
                    I walked to school with a storm inside me, not fear, no, something far sweeter. A trembling anticipation… or maybe both. I felt truly, utterly happy, the kind of happiness that had become my constant companion ever since we began speaking.
                    <br><br>
                    The third lesson was coming to an end, and I sat there, restless, my heart pounding like a mad drum. Then, Taimas and I stepped out into the patio and settled on a bench, right here: (38.358954, -0.430884).<br>
                    I couldn’t bring myself to walk up to you.<br>
                    So we just sat there, and inside me, everything was twisting, spinning, blooming.
                    <br><br>
                    And then... I see you walking.<br>
                    You were with your friends, I think it was Sara and Lilith. You stood slightly to the left of them, closer to me. And then, it happened. The moment our eyes met for the first time since our very first conversation.
                    <br><br>
                    I don’t think I will <em>ever</em> forget that glance!
                    <br><br>
                    Shy, filled with love, so achingly sincere. Your arms hung at your sides, then crossed lightly at your left hip, your hands clasped together as if you felt a little unsure of yourself.
                    <br><br>
                    Ohhh My Goooodddnessssss!!!!!!!
                    <br><br>
                    It lasted only a heartbeat, but within that fleeting instant, there was an <em>entire universe of feeling</em>.<br>
                    I can barely decide which moment was happier - our first kiss or this one.
                    <br><br>
                    During the second break, Taimas and I were walking around the school, and like an absolute fool, I shook your hand and cracked your thumb. Why would I do that? God, that was so awkwardddd.<br>
                    Later, you wrote in your Instagram notes: "me duele la mano".<br>
                    I’m such an idiot. I have no idea what I was thinking.
                    <br><br>
                    And then, when classes were over, we ran into each other on the stairs, the ones to the left if you’re facing the school building entrance. We were both walking down, and the first thing I did was apologize. You just smiled and told me it was okay. After that, we walked home together.<br>
                    We parted ways at this intersection: (38.360791, -0.427766).

                <p>
                    That day, I was going to tell you something important. I think I finished around 14:10 or maybe 15:00, and my last class was Valenciano. We went down to the sports field with the bleachers because there were so few people in the classroom. <strong>And they let us out earlier!</strong> I had even texted you before, saying I needed to tell you something important.<br>
                    I could've waited... I don’t know why I didn’t.

                    And the next day, I walked out of school with you, and we were talking about the kind of pensamientos we had about each other.<br>
                    <em>Pensamientos buenos.</em>

                    Our first walk.
                    <br><br>
                    We agreed to meet at 18:00 by the southern entrance of your urbanisation. I already knew that place, I’d been there before. My friend Alexander used to live there. I remember walking out the door ten minutes early, thinking to myself, "This is it… it’s really happening. What I’ve been dreaming of".
                    <br><br>
                    Exactly at 18:00, I was at the gate. I texted you that I was there, and a couple minutes later, you came out. God… I still remember the way you looked at me in that moment. No words could ever describe it.
                    <br><br>
                    We greeted each other and started walking east, you were on my right.
                    At this crosswalk (38.3626297, -0.4279119), we crossed into the park on Goleta street. As we walked, you told me how you lived in Morocco when you were little, because your dad had some kind of good business opportunity there. You said you studied there for a while, and the hardest part was math, because it was taught in Arabic.
                    <br><br>
                    Then, at this spot (38.3625816, -0.4199679), our walk took an unexpected turn. I asked where we should go, and you said, "Let’s go left," so we headed toward the next crosswalk. When we entered another small park, you told me that not long ago you did an Instagram livestream with Sara, and Eugeni had written awful things in the chat. I remember feeling both confused and furious, how could someone say such disgusting things to a person like <em>you</em>? You also told me that someone once called you an insect because of your eyes... I had no words. And I still don’t. I mean… it’s insane. It’s beyond me.<br>
                    And your eyes… I could praise their beauty <em>forever</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    We kept walking straight, and at the next traffic light I told you it’s always green. You asked if I walk that way often, and I said something like, "Yeah, quite a lot.
                    <br><br>
                    When we passed by the Radio Exterior school and got close to the tree that stands here (38.3660540, -0.4201188), we started talking about name shortenings. I told you that, for example, the name Anton in Russian has different casual versions like Antokha or Tokha. I think you found that funny.
                    <br><br>
                    Then we just kept walking straight and eventually reached the next park after crossing this crosswalk (38.3678920, -0.4216238). We decided to go through that park because the trees gave us shade, and we didn’t want to walk under the sun. That’s where we started talking about <em>nombre patronímico</em>. We also talked about my allergies, how I’m basically allergic to almost everything. And you told me you didn’t have any allergies at all, that you were very healthy. That part happened somewhere around here (38.3664415, -0.4283042).
                    <br><br>
                    Later, near Correos, we turned right and walked down the street where the Aldi and the 24h gym are. You asked me what I thought about the ukrainian war. I said it wasn’t just about capturing territory, there were so many deeper reasons...
                    <br><br>
                    At this intersection (38.3689274, -0.4334239), we turned left. And as we walked toward the traffic light, you told me a secret, that Sara likes Dimitry, and you asked me not to tell him.
                    <br><br>
                    We crossed the park and headed down Miriam Blasco street, where Sara lives now and where I used to live too. I told you the pool there was much bigger than the one we have now. I also noticed that they had changed the gates and mentioned how easy they used to be to climb over. Then, jokingly, I asked you if you liked my hair and you said yes.
                    <br><br>
                    When we passed the roundabout near the Sergio Cardell tram stop, right here (38.3641373, -0.4325578), you told me that when you were little you once fell and broke your two front teeth and that it was the only strange thing that had ever really happened to you.
                    <br><br>
                    As we neared your house, at this crosswalk (38.3625963, -0.4300322), we ran into the class rep from your class. I think he was walking his dog.
                    <br><br>
                    At the very end of our walk, when we were already standing at the gate of your building you hugged me.<br>
                    And in that moment, it was like <em>a flame ignited inside me</em>. A flame that still hasn’t gone out.

                        CLOSE YOUR EYES AND I'LL KISS YOU<br>

                    </strong>
                    <br><br>
                    That line is from the Beatles song All My Loving. On April 4th, we walked home together after school, like we always did, talking about something or other, and parted ways at our usual intersection. I told you I’d be in France for a few days. That evening, I wrote in my Instagram notes: "Close your eyes and I'll kiss you, tomorrow I'll miss you."
                    <br><br>
                    You <em>replied</em> with "do it", but then deleted it and wrote instead: "I'll send all my loving to you."
                    <br><br>
                    Later, when we were chatting on Telegram and talking about music, you mentioned that you were paying for Spotify Premium, and I told you that you could listen to any music for free using a Telegram bot. I told you to name any song so I could send you the link, and explained that the link below the song file was just an ad, the one above was the real one. You picked All My Loving by the Beatles, and I sent it to you.
                    <br><br>
                    Then you said something like: "<em>mi estado actual es bailando en mi habitación.</em>"

                    Me and my family were on our way home, returning from our trip to France. It was around 9 in the evening. I was sitting in the front seat of the car, staring at the dark night sky. And I was thinking about you…<br>
                    Suddenly, right before my eyes, I saw a bright line of light quickly vanish into the night. At first, I didn’t realize it was a shooting star, but then my dad, who was driving, saw it too and said something like, “Did you all see that? Was that a shooting star?” And in that moment, I was sure it was. It was the first time in my life that I had ever seen one.<br>
                    Do you know what I wished for?<br>
                    Oh, my love… I wished to kiss you, just once.<br>
                    And my wish came true a month and a half later.
                    <br><br>
                    In August 2025, I saw another one, but that story… I’ll only tell you in person, if you ever want me to.

                    I recall how we randomly ran into each other when I was heading home after English academy. Not the first time, when you were walking with your friend Sara and we crossed paths at the crosswalk (38.3637914, -0.4265128), but the second time, when you were alone.
                    <br><br>
                    It happened a bit farther from the academy. I was already on my way toward the park on Goleta Street because I usually took that route. I noticed you from a distance, walking while doing something on your phone. When we stopped together at the traffic light (38.3627325, -0.4242205), I pretended not to see you for a few moments because I felt a little awkward. But, God, inside, I was ecstatic!
                    <br>
                    I said hi, and we started walking together, talking. You told me you were just out for a walk, and I was on my way home. Our encounter was brief, but it was perfect.
                    <br><br>
                    My happiest coincidence ever!... Or maybe it wasn't a coincidence... who knows :)

                    We were walking around the Cabo area, one of our very first walks together. As we were crossing the street at this crosswalk: (38.360928, -0.418755), I remember you told me that you hoped to be chosen for the exchange program to the U.S. during Bachillerato.

                <p>
                    I remember one of your stories on your Instagram account <strong>wsdbwl</strong>. You were out walking, and your phone had only one percent battery left, and you posted a photo that looked a lot like this one. (I took this one on April 9, 2025 at 19:40.)
                </p>
                <img src="assets\img\6.jpg" alt="6.jpg">
                <p>
                    I remember wanting to reply to that story, but I just couldn’t find the right words. You see, in Russian there's a word "жиза", it basically means that a situation is super relatable, like something that happens to you often in real life. It’s a slang word, so there’s really no proper translation for it. And if you try to translate it literally, it turns into complete nonsense. And that was the only thing that came to my mind back then... but I didn’t know how to explain it to you, so I ended up not replying at all.

                    Do you remember that time we were walking near the lighthouse, and when we passed by (38.3561231, -0.4088200), we crossed paths with a guy pushing his grandmother in a wheelchair? And when the granny saw us, she said, "Que pareja más bonita." It gave me such a warm and pleasant feeling that I can’t quite describe. I asked you a moment later, "Nos ha llamado pareja?" and you answered a bit shyly, "Si."
                    <br><br>
                    Oh... My love, I remember that as if it was yesterday!

                    We were together again, side by side.
                    This time, we were sitting in the park near El Faro school, where my younger brother studies. Sitting right on this bench: (38.360780, -0.414300). You were on my right, slightly turned toward me. I suggested a game, we’d look into each other’s eyes, and the first one to look away would lose. You agreed.<br>
                    Oh God, my dear… I remember exactly what I felt in that moment. It was like… <strong>the collision of two galaxies</strong>, just as grand, just as overwhelming, and absolutely <em>gorgeous</em>.<br>
                    <em>Your gaze</em>… my God! That gaze full of softness, kindness, love… I can’t describe it with words. I will never ever forget it. Never.
                    <br><br>
                    Later, we talked about perfumes. I asked you what perfume you used, and you said one from Victoria’s Secret. Then you asked what mine was and I told you, Tobacco Vanille by Tom Ford.

                    We were sitting on a bench (38.361735, -0.433973) in the park del Presidente Adolfo Suárez, playing Truth or Dare, but only the truth part, no dares. You had found an online version of the game on your phone, and we were playing from there. There were all sorts of questions, but I was secretly waiting for just one. And finally, it came up:
                    <br><br>
                    "When was your first kiss?"
                    <br><br>
                    You told me, "Te sorprendes si te digo que mi novio no me besaba?" Then you asked me when mine was, and I told you I hadn’t had one either.
                    <br><br>
                    Somehow, the conversation shifted, and I asked you, "Y ahora te gusta alguien?" You answered shyly, "Sí…" and then asked me the same question. I looked at you, trying not to give myself away, because YES, I did like someone, and that someone was YOU!!! But I just smiled and replied, "A mí también".
                    <br><br>
                    In that moment, I realized I had a chance. The way you answered, the way you looked at me - I knew you were talking about me. And I was happy. So happy.

                    I remember at the end of May, back when we were still at school, I saw you in the changing room. I think you were wearing a blue tee. There was some sort of commotion going on in the gym, and you came to check it out, or at least that’s what it looked like to me, maybe you were actually there for something else.
                    <br><br>
                    God, how badly I wanted to kiss you in that moment! There was no one in sight, <em>just you and me</em>. I didn’t care what anyone might think if they saw us. All I could feel was this intense pull toward you.
                    <br><br>
                    But I didn’t do it. I didn’t dare. It was near the end of the break, and the bell rang, I think that’s how it happened, at least that’s how I remember it.
                    <br><br>
                    What do you think? Should I have done it? Did you even see me back then? And if you did, what were you thinking? Maybe, just maybe, you wanted me to kiss you too... Or maybe… you didn’t even notice me.

                    That evening we walked around Cabo.<br>
                    The air was soft and your voice… your voice kept floating beside me like music. You told me you were going to a Coldplay concert the next day, your eyes lit up as you showed me videos of the glowing balloons, the crowd singing in unison… I remember thinking, "She deserves this kind of beauty every day."
                    <br><br>
                    We also spoke about the Russian army. When we passed that corner (38.355764, -0.424803) I said I was a patriot, yes, but not to the point of dying in a war. I remember you didn’t judge. You just listened.

                <p>
                    That day, I added you to my Github repository with the love confession.
                    <br><br>
                    We were sitting on the bench at Albufereta beach (38.3634036, -0.4428894). On the way there, I asked you if you’d tried solving that riddle again, and you said yes, more than once. Then I asked if it would be okay with you if I made you a contributor to the repository, because it was on my main account and I wanted to make it private so only you and I could see it.
                    <br><br>
                    When we got to that bench, we decided to do it right away. You created a GitHub account, I added you as a collaborator, and made the repo private. Then we just sat there watching the setting sun. You were sitting on my left. From time to time, I turned to look at you, and you kept asking things like, "What is it? Why are you looking at me?" And I had no words. I just wanted to take in the beauty of <em>your eyes</em>, even for a moment. At one point I told you how beautiful your eyes were. I turned a few more times and then you kissed me. The truth is, I just didn’t have the courage to kiss you first.
                    <br><br>
                    Eventually, it was time to go home, since your mom had asked you to be back by a certain time. I didn’t want to leave. When we stood up, I held out my left hand, palm up, so we could walk hand in hand. You didn’t notice right away, but a moment later you took it. It felt a bit awkward, your hand being in front of mine, just physically uncomfortable, so I gently adjusted our grip so that my hand was in front. I’m not sure if you understood what I meant just now, but I tried to explain it clearly. I hope you did.
                    <br><br>
                    When we were walking past the restaurant near your home, some friends of your parents were sitting there, and you let go of my hand so they wouldn’t see us together. I wasn’t bothered by it at all, I understood. And even now, I would’ve reacted the same way. I get it, really. There’s nothing wrong with that.
                    <br><br>
                    And I think that’s where that walk ended - I walked you to your home, and then headed home myself.

                    We were talking on Telegram through video messages… talking longer than ever before. You told me so many things that night.
                    <br><br>
                    I remember saying how much I wanted to embrace you, and you answered, "A lo mejor cuando vuelvas hago algo más que abrazarte." I never really understood what you meant. And when I came back, we didn’t say a word to each other.
                    <br>
                    Or when you said, "No me has hecho sufrir ninguna vez." Every time I remember that, my heart just shatters...
                    <br>
                    And when I added you to my Telegram channel with my poems, you read them and said, "Si te digo que estoy llorando, me crees?"
                    <br><br>
                    Oh, darling...
                    <br><br>
                    By the time it was already getting light outside, around 3:30 AM, you told me you needed to sleep because you had to wake up for school. You couldn’t skip that day because they were giving out biology grades. You went to bed, and I went outside to do pull-ups on the bar.
                    <br>
                    I remember that feeling so vividly. The cool night air, the empty streets, me trying to record you a video message but having nowhere to put my phone. Some guy pulled up in a red car and walked into his house. I barely even noticed him.
                    <br><br>
                    I was gleeful. So damn gleeful. I had never felt anything like that before.

                    I was drunk that night. I remember drinking Beefeater London Dry Gin, mixing it with apple juice. Wrote to you around midnight: "Te quiero ❤️❤️❤️" and you answered "Te quiero más" ... "Pasa algo?" And I said "No, solo te quería decir que te amo..."
                    <br>
                    Then I started rambling about how if I don’t text you, it doesn’t mean I’ve forgotten about you, that I just have things to do. Oh, God… what things? What the hell could have been more important than you?

                    These pictures were taken exactly at 5:00 AM Moscow time. The sun was already rising, and I still hadn’t gone to bed.

                <p>
                    One hot summer night in the Moscow suburbs, back in 2023, I had a dream about you.
                    <br><br>
                    In the dream, I was riding in a vehicle with someone I didn’t recognize in real life, but somehow I knew him in the dream. We were transporting some kind of cargo. Suddenly, we were stopped by security forces on a low bridge. I didn’t know what we were carrying. We left the vehicle and had to flee. My "partner" disappeared somewhere, and I climbed down under the bridge. There, I saw a strange door left slightly ajar. I stepped inside.
                    <br><br>
                    What I found was a massive labyrinth of books. It was a library, but one so vast it was beyond imagination. The only light came from candles in candelabras, hanging off the towering wooden bookshelves. The corridors were narrow and dark, with low ceilings, and every now and then, I’d come across a dead end where a table stood - dark brown wood, same shade as the shelves, with three chairs around it. Only candles lit those small spaces.
                </p>
                <img src="assets\img\9.jpg" alt="9.jpg">
                <p>
                    I wandered that maze for what felt like forever. Not searching for a way out, not feeling lost, just walking.
                    <br><br>
                    And then, in one of those hidden nooks, I saw <em>you</em>. You were sitting at one of the tables, reading. At first, I didn’t recognize you. I approached from behind and, I think, softly said your name. You turned around, and in your eyes, I saw sorrow. But also a quiet joy. I could feel that you were glad to see me. You stood up, looked at me for a moment, and then hugged me. Tightly. And you began to cry silently. I held you too. And in that embrace, I could feel <em>all your love</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    But it didn’t last. I woke up.
                    <br><br>
                    And now, nearly two years later, I still remember the feeling of holding you in that dark, endless library. I haven’t forgotten. I don’t think I ever will.

                <p>
                    One summer evening, I was watching a travel show about China with Dmitry Komarov when you messaged me. We started talking, and somehow the topic turned to coffee. I’ve always been against things like caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and so on, they all affect health negatively, even if the impact isn’t immediate. I tried to explain that coffee isn’t good for the heart, that because of the caffeine it can mess with the rhythm and, when consumed often, might cause permanent harm. At that time, I drank coffee very rarely or not at all, even though I liked it.
                    <br><br>
                    I had no intention of limiting you, and I didn’t want you to think I was trying to forbid anything. I was just trying to share what I believed, from a good place in my heart. I don’t know if my good intentions reached you the way I hoped.
                    <br><br>
                    But you said it was nice that someone cared about you like that, or at least that’s how I understood it. I don’t remember how the conversation ended. I guess you told me you wouldn’t go out with the person who invited you for a coffee.
                    <br><br>
                    And now, that episode about China is forever linked in my mind with that conversation. Here’s the <a href="https://youtu.be/bvoF_lFC_gg?si=V6bPGAKLE0eN1eUi" target="_blank">link</a> to it. I don’t know if you’ll ever need it, but let it stay here.

                    Today my day became brighter, happier, just because of your fleeting glance.<br>

                <p>
                    It was a Thursday.<br>
                    Our last class of the day was PE, both yours and mine. Outside, it was pouring rain. I walked out of the gym and headed toward the exit. That’s when I saw you. You were standing there with some guy in an embrace, as far as I know his name is Asier. He was in my radio class last year.<br>
                    You were hugging him.<br>
                    It wasn’t the first time I’d seen something like that. Sometimes, it made me angry. Other times, I felt happy for you, you looked like you were glowing, genuinely happy.<br>
                    But in that moment, I felt… nothing.
                    <br><br>
                    I decided to wait for the rain to stop.<br>
                    But I didn’t wait under the roof outside, I went back in and sat on one of the chairs near the entrance. The same two chairs where my little brother and I usually sit during breaks.<br>
                    By the way, my brother Egor didn’t wait for the rain, he left right away without an umbrella and got completely soaked.<br>
                    I sat there thinking… about you.<br>
                    Of course. Who else would I think about at a moment like that? I was wondering if you were cold, if you’d get wet walking in the rain, if you had an umbrella… I think if that guy hadn’t been with you, I might’ve come up to you. Maybe. Maybe not. I don’t know.
                    <br><br>
                    The whole time, I was listening on repeat to the same song:
                    KRBK - "Девушка в чёрном."
                    <br><br>
                    I remember when you came inside and, after a while, walked back out. I turned my gaze away. I don’t know why I do that. I’m not shy. No. Maybe I want to look cool… unaffected. But why? I really don’t know.<br>
                    When you were coming out of the corridor that leads to the canteen, you said: "Joder, está helado."
                    I didn’t quite understand what exactly was "helado."
                </p>
                <img src="assets\img\5.jpg" alt="5.jpg">
                <p>
                    I accidentally took this photo at 15:14 while pulling my phone out of my pocket.
                    <br><br>
                    Then my grandma called. We talked for a couple of minutes.<br>
                    Once the rain finally stopped and the sun came out, I got up and made my way home. I stepped outside, and to my disappointment you were already gone. You had left.<br>
                    I walked home completely dry, not a single raindrop touched me.<br>
                    And later that day, my dad came home from his business trip to Ethiopia, unannounced. It was a lovely surprise.

                <p>
                    I don’t remember exactly when in March it was, but I had another dream about you.
                    <br><br>
                    Lately, I’ve been dreaming of you more and more often, but this one was different. We were at school, and I happened to overhear you talking to your friends. I only caught one sentence but it stayed with me: <em>"I love him too, but we can't be together."</em> I don’t know if it was some kind of vision or just my mind fixating on what it longs to hear.
                    <br><br>
                    My love… is it true? Do you love me? Do you at least remember me?

                    I walked past our spot. A black Jeep Wrangler was parked there - the car you once said you liked.

                    I don’t understand why you keep looking my TikTok profile, checking my reposts. Why, tell me. Do you really still care? Or is it just to plant false hope in me?
                    <br><br>
                    You’ve viewed my profile exactly 16 times. Not once, not twice - <strong>sixteen</strong>!!<br>
                    Why?<br>
                    There were even days when you visited my profile at the exact same time, day after day. Just recently, on March 21st, 22nd, and 23rd. And today, two hours ago.<br>
                    And in December 2024, it was a whole week straight. Every single day. December 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, and 30th. And on the 31st - New Year’s Eve - just a few hours before midnight.
                    <br><br>
                    Why??

                    And here you are again, visiting my profile. The 17th time. Three hours ago. Somewhere around 20:00. The same time as yesterday.

                    Everything disappeared. Where has it gone? Have you blocked me? Have you deleted your account? Why...?

                    Everything's okay now :) I guess there was some kind of glitch with your TikTok. Or maybe mine. Couldn’t find it through search, and it disappeared from the profile visit history.<br>
                    But today… you checked my profile again. Around 20:00, just like before. The 18th time.
                    <br><br>
                    And at school… I haven’t seen you since Friday.  
                    You must be on that exchange program with Finland…
