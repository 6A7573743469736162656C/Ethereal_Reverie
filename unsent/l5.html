                    I’m flying to Paris.<br>
                    At 7:19 the plane lifted its wheels off the ground, and just 20 minutes later it was already soaring at 10,500 meters, speeding at 750 km/h, heading to Orly airport.
                    <br><br>
                    Heights have always inspired me. I remember flying to Moscow on June 9, 2023, around 6:30 in the morning. I wrote in my black notebook, the one where you left me a message and told me to read it later, "The sky inspires. I'm flying to Moscow."<br>
                    I’ve always preferred early flights. Waking up while it’s still dark, driving to the airport while the night still lingers, and then watching the sky brighten as the plane takes off. Evenings are nice too, but I don’t like waiting… and during evening flights, you end up waiting the whole day.<br>
                    I don’t know why, but this time I feel no excitement. There’s no spark. I used to love flying, but now it just feels like a form of transport. It’s been like this for a while now, not the first year. Maybe it’s for the better.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m listening to X’s by Cigarettes After Sex. Of course, every song by Greg Gonzalez reminds me of you. Only you.
                    <br><br>
                    13:06
                    The Eiffel Tower really is a beautiful architectural piece. They say Paris is the city of lovers…<br>
                    Would you want to be here with me right now?
                    <br><br>
                    14:05<br>
                    I feel lonely in this city.
                    <br><br>
                    14:40<br>
                    Have you ever been to Paris?
                    <br><br>
                    15:12<br>
                    Paris no longer feels like the city of love to me. It feels like <em>the city of heartbreak.</em>
                    <br><br>
                    21:36<br>
                    At the end of the day, I don’t even know what to say… my feelings are mixed.<br>
                    In a way, I feel nothing at all. For some reason, it feels like I’ve come home. France doesn’t feel foreign to me, though I’ve only been here twice (Toulouse and Marseille), I don’t feel like a stranger. I understand the culture, the lifestyle makes sense to me... The only thing is… there are a lot of blacks here. I mean a LOT.<br>
                    Still, the city left me with a calm impression, a sense of peace. I even experienced déjà vu twice.<br>
                    But even so, I felt lonely. <em>More than ever</em>. And this isn’t just any city, it’s the so-called "city of love"... Yet my love… she’s far away somewhere, with no idea that I’m sitting here right now, writing her a letter that will likely never reach her eyes.
