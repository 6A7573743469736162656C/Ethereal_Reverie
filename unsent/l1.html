                    Darling,
                    <br><br>
                    It’s raining outside... That scent - damp air, wet pavements suddenly brought me back to 2013, when I was just five years old.<br>
                    I remember… it was autumn, in a town near Moscow called Podolsk. My dad picked me up from kindergarten, we drove home in our blue Honda. On the radio, "Coming Home" by Skylar Grey & Diddy was playing. I was filled with excitement, eager to get home, grab my PSP... It had a photo of a helicopter as the wallpaper. It was loaded with games and music.
                    <br><br>
                    And now, years later, I find myself walking under the Spanish sky, speaking a language that once felt foreign, living a life that child in Podolsk could never have imagined.<br>
                    And where were you in that moment, my love? What were the skies like over your world? What did you see through the eyes of a child, untouched by time?<br>
                    Do you ever think about that part of your childhood?
                    <br><br>
                    Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about my past... not in a sad way, but with deep nostalgia.<br>
                    These memories are some of my most intimate, sacred ones. No one in the world knows them like I do… not even my family would remember the details. But I want to share them with you. I don’t know why… I just feel this kind of urge.
